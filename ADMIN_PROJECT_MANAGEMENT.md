# Admin Project Management System

This document explains the implementation of the admin project management features that allow administrators to track and update project progress.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Project Tracking
- Fetches actual project data from Firestore instead of using mock data
- Displays all projects in the system with their current status
- Shows project owners and target completion dates

### 2. Project Status Management
- Admins can change project status (planning, active, on-hold, completed, cancelled)
- Real-time updates to both admin dashboard and customer dashboard
- Visual indicators for each status type

### 3. Milestone Management
- Toggle milestone completion status with a single click
- Edit milestone details (title, description, phase, weight)
- Visual feedback for completed vs pending milestones

### 4. Project Editing
- Edit project names directly in the admin interface
- Change project status through dropdown selection
- Save changes with confirmation

## Key Components

### ProjectWorkflow.tsx
The main component that displays all projects and allows admin interactions.

### Data Flow
1. **Firestore** → **ProjectWorkflow** - Fetches real project data
2. **Admin Actions** → **Firestore** - Updates are saved directly to database
3. **Firestore** → **Customer Dashboard** - Changes are reflected in customer view

## Implementation Details

### Project Data Structure
Projects are stored in the `userProgress` collection in Firestore with the following structure:
- `projectInfo`: Project details (name, status, dates)
- `progress`: Overall progress tracking
- `milestones`: Array of project milestones
- `userId`: Associated user ID

### Admin Actions
1. **Status Changes**: Updates the `projectInfo.status` field
2. **Milestone Toggles**: Uses the `progressService.updateMilestone` method
3. **Project Editing**: Direct updates to project document in Firestore
4. **Milestone Editing**: Updates the milestones array in the project document

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard → Project Workflow tab
2. View all projects in the left panel
3. Click on any project to see its details
4. Edit project name by clicking the edit button and modifying the text field
5. Change project status using the dropdown selector
6. Toggle milestone completion by clicking the circle/check icon
7. Edit milestone details by clicking the edit icon next to each milestone

### For Customers
1. Project status changes will be reflected in their dashboard
2. Milestone completion will update their progress tracking
3. Any admin notes or updates will appear in their project tracking display

## Technical Notes

- All updates are performed directly on Firestore documents
- The component uses React state for immediate UI updates with Firestore as the source of truth
- Error handling is implemented for all database operations
- The interface is fully responsive and works on all device sizes
- Loading states provide feedback during data fetching

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Actions**: Allow admins to update multiple projects at once
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter projects by status, date, or user
3. **Export Functionality**: Export project data to CSV or PDF
4. **Notifications**: Send automatic notifications to customers when admins update their projects
5. **Timeline View**: Visual timeline of all project milestones
6. **Team Assignment**: Assign team members to specific milestones
7. **Comments**: Add comments to projects or milestones for internal team communication
